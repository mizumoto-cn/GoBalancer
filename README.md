## Forward Proxy and Reverse Proxy

Maybe most of us have used proxies. A forward proxy can be roughly defined as a domain between user client and the internet, which hides the real client from the internet, acting as if they(proxies) are users themselves.

And vice versa. So there are reverse proxies hiding concrete servers from the client. Like the pic shown beneath.
